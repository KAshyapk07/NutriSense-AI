Paneer Methi Paratha Recipe,Paneer parantha/paratha,50,North Indian Recipes,"To begin making the Paneer Methi Paratha Recipe, we will first need to make the dough for the parathas.
In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt.
Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour.Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough.

Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface.
Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place the a portion of the filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around.
Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the paratha.
Once sealed press down the paneer paratha with your palms to release any air pockets.
And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out.
Proceed the same way with the remaining paratha dough and filling portions.Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a paneer methi paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.
